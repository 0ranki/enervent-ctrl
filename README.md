# Enervent-control

External control of an Enervent Pingvin
Kotilämpö residential heating/ventilation
unit via RS485 bus using the Modbus protocol.

Readme will be updated in the near future.

Work part of my Bachelor's Thesis at Oulu University
of Applied Sciences.

The daemon is designed to run on a Linux host
that has some sort of RS-485 connector attached.
For development a RPi Zero W 1 with a
connected [Zihatec RS 485 HAT](https://www.hwhardsoft.de/english/projects/rs485-shield/?mobile=1)
has been used to make sure the daemon stays as
lightweight as possible.
